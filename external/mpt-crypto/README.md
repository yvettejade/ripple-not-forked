# MPT-Crypto: Cryptographic Primitives for Confidential Assets

## Overview

**MPT-Crypto** is a specialized C library implementing the cryptographic building blocks for
**Confidential Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPT)** on the XRP Ledger. It provides implementations of homomorphic encryption, aggregated range proofs, and specialized zero-knowledge proofs.
The library is built on top of `libsecp256k1` for elliptic curve arithmetic and OpenSSL for hashing and randomness.

## Features

### 1. Confidential Balances (EC-ElGamal)

- **Additive Homomorphic Encryption:** Enables the ledger to aggregate encrypted balances (e.g., `Enc(A) + Enc(B) = Enc(A+B)`) without decryption.
- **Canonical Zero:** Deterministic encryption of zero balances to prevent ledger state bloat and ensure consistency.

### 2. Range Proofs (Bulletproofs)

- **Aggregated Proofs:** Supports proving that $m$ values are within the range $[0, 2^{64})$ in a single proof with logarithmic size $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$.
- **Inner Product Argument (IPA):** Implements the standard Bulletproofs IPA for succinct verification.
- **Fiat-Shamir:** Secure non-interactive challenge generation with strict domain separation.

### 3. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Sigma Protocols)

- **Compact AND-Composed Sigma Proofs:** Proves ciphertext equality, Pedersen commitment linkage, and balance ownership under a single Fiat-Shamir challenge. Three variants cover the standard send, convert-back, and clawback transaction types.
- **Proof of Knowledge (PoK):** Proves ownership of the secret key during account registration to prevent rogue key attacks.

## Building and Testing

### Prerequisites

Before building, ensure you have the following installed:

- **CMake** (version 3.10 or higher)
- **C Compiler** (GCC, Clang, or AppleClang)

On macOS with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install cmake
```

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential
```

### Dependency Setup

Set up Conan using [rippled's BUILD.md](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/develop/BUILD.md#steps).

Dependency revisions are pinned via a Conan lockfile (`conan.lock`) at the repository root; Conan picks it up implicitly on `conan install`. To regenerate after editing `conanfile.py`, run `./conan/lockfile/regenerate.sh` from the repo root. The pattern mirrors [rippled's `conan/lockfile/`](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/tree/develop/conan/lockfile).

### Build Instructions

Run following commands to build the library

1. Create build directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

2. Buld dependencies:

   ```bash
   conan install .. --build=missing -o "&:tests=True"
   ```

3. Run CMake:

   ```bash
   cmake .. \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -G Ninja \
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE:FILEPATH=build/generators/conan_toolchain.cmake
   ```

4. **Build the library and tests:**

   ```bash
   ninja
   ```

### Running Tests

After building, run the test suite using CTest from the build directory:

```bash
ctest --output-on-failure
```

Or run individual tests directly:

```bash
./tests/test_elgamal
./tests/test_bulletproof_agg
./tests/test_commitments
```

### Expected Results

The following tests should pass:

- `test_bulletproof_agg` - Aggregated Bulletproof range proofs
- `test_commitments` - Pedersen commitments
- `test_compact_clawback` - Compact sigma proof for clawback
- `test_compact_convertback` - Compact sigma proof for convert-back
- `test_compact_standard` - Compact sigma proof for standard send
- `test_elgamal` - ElGamal encryption/decryption
- `test_elgamal_verify` - ElGamal verification
- `test_ipa` - Inner Product Argument (IPA) Core Logic
- `test_mpt_utility` - End-to-end utility layer (send, convert, convert-back, clawback)
- `test_pok_sk` - Proof of knowledge of secret key
